### What I learned

In this challenge, I trained in building this modern, geometric layout, with some sections that were a little difficult at first glance, but at the same time it was fun to understand how to adjust the various structures for each viewport. It helped me better understand how to make more complex layouts than usual.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop layouts of this "difficulty" going step by step and trying to learn something new each time that can be useful to me in the future.
